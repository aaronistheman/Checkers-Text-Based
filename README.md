# Checkers-Text-Based


About
-----

Please see my repository Checkers-with-GUI for a better version of this application.

This is a Checkers application that I programmed during the summer (2013) after my sophomore year in high school, before I knew anything of object-oriented programming. Thus, the code, divided among many files, consists of many functions, and may not be particularly well-written.

I programmed this in C++. I used Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express.

See the following video for a demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTYLoOd7v8. 


Features
--------

This application supports the general rules of checkers, including crowned pieces and double captures.


Directions
----------

To open the project, open Checkers.sln with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express. Run the project to try it.

To see additional commands while running the project, enter "help" or "h".


Releases
--------

The most recent release is: v0.1

The latest code can be found under the releases section of this Git repository.
